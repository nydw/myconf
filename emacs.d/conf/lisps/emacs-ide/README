Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Emacs-IDE is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) interface for Emacs
(code browsing, compilation, debug...).

The purpose is to provide a user-friendly interface, with dedicated windows
(source, menu and output) and convenient shortcuts.

It is suitable for almost all languages (as long as they are supported by
Ctags). Cscope provides additional browsing facility for C/C++ files.

        -----------------------------------------------------------
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |       "source" window                   | "menu" window |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        |                                         |               |
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        |                                                         |
        |               "output" window                           |
        |                                                         |
        -----------------------------------------------------------

If you click on right button over "source" window, all other windows are
closed. Click again to get them back.

Instructions are available in "Help" page: click on right button over "menu"
window, and select "Help" in popup menu.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Default configuration overrides some Emacs settings (including your own
settings in ~/.emacs), in order to take advantage of all user-friendly
features.

If you don't want to override these settings, you can disable "Override Emacs
settings" option in customization: click on right button over "menu" window,
select "Configuration" in popup menu, disable "Override Emacs settings" option,
click on "Save for future sessions", and click on right button to exit
customization.

You can also disable only the settings that you don't want to override (in
"Emacs settings" group).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick start
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory from which Emacs is launched stands as the root directory. You
can change it during the session: click on right button over "menu" window, and
select "Change root directory" in popup menu.

To create a project, select the directory of the source code tree as the root
directory. Click on right button over "menu" window, and select "Create a
project in this directory". The project is added to your workspace.

To open your project in future sessions, click on right button over "menu"
window, select "Display projects list", and select your project.
